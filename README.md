Sets and Settings first iphone game. Made with Futile for Unity.

A huge thanks to Matt Rix for even making this project possible.

Notes
=====

This is only the code from the "Scripts" folder. The setup itself is no different from any other Unity/Futile project.

I wrote this code when Futile was less than a month old. There was almost no documentation at the time.

As such, it's not only possible, but likely, that I vastly mis-used parts of the framework. 

I tried to comment parts that might not be so obvious, but there's a lot. There's probably debug code lying around from the early stages of the game.
